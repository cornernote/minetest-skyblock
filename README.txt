DESCRIPTION
----------------------------------

Build a world starting from a small island in the sky. This Minetest mod is intended to be used as a minimal game that allows the player to craft and use all the default items in Minetest in a fun and challenging way.

* WARNING * - this mod will disable all map generation in any world the mod is active!

Because of this, some things have to be different:
- death results in losing all your items
- falling below skyblock.WORLD_BOTTOM results in death
- flowing lava and water collide to make stone
- crafts to allow access to all items
- prevent chopping down trees with bare hands
- abms to control spawning and growing nodes


----------------------------------
PLAYING INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------------------


-- Level Achievement Block --

Punch (short left click) to refresh your achievements.

Dig (long left click) to respawn at a new location with new items.

Open (right click) to view current achievements.


-- Death Hurts --

If you fall below skyblock.WORLD_BOTTOM you will restart at a new spawn point.


-- Stone Generator --

Create stone done by placing lava and water next to each other with air between.  Stone nodes will appear between them.


-- Infinite Water --

If you want to create more water simply place your 2 water sources so they touch diagonally.  Now when you take one with the bucket, it will be replaced.


-- Crafting --

To learn all of the crafts you can visit the SkyBlock GameWiki:
http://cornernote.net/minetest/skyblock/wiki/crafts.php

OCEAN MODE
----------------------------------

Inside config.lua you can set skyblock.MODE to either water or lava to create an endless ocean around your starting island.


----------------------------------
MULTIPLAYER SUPPORT
----------------------------------

Although the default settings will work, you may want to consider the starting positions.

Each player is given a unique spawn position in an outwards spriral.

If skyblock.WORLD_WIDTH=5 then players will be assigned in the following positions:
(looking down)

x+5|  21  22  23  24  25
   |
x+4|  20  07  08  09  10
   |
x+3|  19  06  01  02  11
   |
x+2|  18  05  04  03  12
   |                      <-- The distance between the players is 
x+1|  17  16  15  14  13      defined by skyblock.START_GAP.
   +--------------------
     z+1 z+2 z+3 z+4 z+5

Note:
Your world will be limited to skyblock.WORLD_WIDTH*skyblock.WORLD_WIDTH players.
